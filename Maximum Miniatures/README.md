These are reports on a fictitious company called Maximum Miniatures from the book "Delivering Business Intelligence with Microsoft SQL Server 2016"
The first dashboard consists of reports that were created from the books instructions while the second dashboard consists of reports I created on my own.
I included reports from the books as I felt they gave a good glance at the company but decided to focus on increasing loyalty in the second dashboard.
I included the top spending customers and products as well as a map to show revenue in each state.
I included an average sales value as an aid to implement potential loyalty offers. The average is around $90 dollars so we can set a spending minimum of $90 to recieve free shipping for online orders or 10% off coupons given in store for the next purchase.
I included a median spent each year value as well as a gauge to start loyaly levels. I used median instead of average because the ranges that customers were spending were varying from $50/year to millions per year. I felt median was a better indicator for the majority of customers.
